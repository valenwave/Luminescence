## Task Applications

I like now Google Task handle recurring tasks. I use Any.Do for most everything else. Dropbox Paper has a global checklist dashboard for all checklist items. This could be useful if you have a shopping list that spans multiple documents but can get messy if you have a checklist that isn't intended as a to-do item. Note: Checking an item from the global checklist will check off the item in the document. However, if you check off the item in the document, the global checklist isn't updated until you do a full app refresh--if on mobile device; a tab switch from "By doc" to "In this doc" and vice-versa on computer.
